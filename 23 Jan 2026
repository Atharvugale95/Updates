Tasks completed:
Task 1 : Look into ThreadPoolExecutor and ProcessPoolExecutor in Python and understand how they differ and when each one should be used.
Using that knowledge, add parallel processing to analyze the three log files (small.log, medium.log, and large.log) more efficiently.
 
Task 2 : Learn how regular expressions work in Python using the built-in re module.
Implement a case-insensitive regex search on the log description field so users can filter log entries using a search pattern.
